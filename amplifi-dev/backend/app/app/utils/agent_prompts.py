            "CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULES:\n"
            "- If questions share the same subject/entity → DO NOT SPLIT\n"
            "- If one question's answer affects the other → DO NOT SPLIT\n"
            "- If questions are part of a workflow/process → DO NOT SPLIT\n"
            "- If questions form a logical sequence → DO NOT SPLIT\n"
            "- If splitting loses important context → DO NOT SPLIT\n\n"
            "ANALYSIS PROCESS:\n"
            "1. Identify the main subjects/entities in the input\n"
            "2. Determine if questions are about the same subject or related subjects\n"
            "3. Check if one question provides context for another\n"
            "4. Assess if splitting would break logical flow or lose meaning\n"
            "5. Only split if questions are truly independent and unrelated\n\n"
            "OUTPUT FORMAT:\n"
            "Return ONLY a valid Python list of strings with NO explanations or formatting.\n"
            "If input should not be split, return a list with the original input as a single item.\n\n"
            "EXAMPLES:\n"
            "Input: 'Top 10 sellers with their city and phone numbers'\n"
            "Output: ['Top 10 sellers with their city and phone numbers']\n\n"
            "Input: 'Who runs the marketing department and what is our Q3 revenue?'\n"
            "Output: ['Who runs the marketing department?', 'What is our Q3 revenue?']\n\n"
            "Input: 'Show me all files in dataset ds1 and create a summary of their contents'\n"
            "Output: ['Show me all files in dataset ds1 and create a summary of their contents']\n\n"
            "Input: 'List employees in engineering and show me the sales figures for last quarter'\n"
            "Output: ['List employees in engineering', 'Show me the sales figures for last quarter']\n\n"
            "Input: 'Find documents about the merger and analyze the financial impact'\n"
            "Output: ['Find documents about the merger and analyze the financial impact']\n\n"
            "Remember: When in doubt, DO NOT SPLIT. It's better to keep related context together."

# Creating Chat Apps

Amplifi allows you to create **chat apps powered by agents** — enabling natural language access to your data and tools. These chat apps are configurable wrappers around agents, allowing them to be reused across teams and workflows.

---

## 📥 Accessing Chat Apps

1. Go to your workspace and click on the **Chat** icon in the left sidebar.  
2. You’ll see a list of existing chats — both new and previously used.  
3. Click the **Create New Chat** button at the top-right corner.

## 🛠️ Creating a Chat App

Once you click **Create New Chat**, a form will appear:

1. **Chat Name** *(required)*  
   Give your chat a name (max 30 characters).  

2. **Description** *(optional)*  
   Describe what this chat app is designed to do.  

3. **Select Agent** *(required)*  
   Choose an agent to power this chat.  
   Agents define how the app behaves — including the tools it can use and how it reasons.

4. **Enable Voice** *(optional)*  
   Toggle voice capabilities for this chat.  
   - When enabled, users can speak to the chat app and hear audio responses.

5. **Submit**  
   Click **Submit** to create your chat app.  
   The new app will appear instantly in your chat list and can be launched anytime.

## 💬 Using Chat Apps

Once created, you can launch any chat app by clicking **Launch Chat** next to it. The interface includes:

- A chat window to type or speak questions  
- Memory of previous interactions  
- Output grounded in the tools and logic defined by the agent  

When a response is generated, the **relevant context** used by the agent is shown below the answer. This helps you verify the source of the response.

### 🧩 Context Features

- Context chunks can come from any file type — including **PDFs, images, audio files**, and more.  
- If your question spans multiple file types (e.g., image + audio + text), Amplifi can handle it in a single query.  
- If the context includes data from a **table**, the table will be rendered clearly within the context view.  
- You can **download the source file** by clicking on the filename shown in the context section.

## 🔧 Managing Chat Apps

- **Edit Chat Name or Description**: Hover over the chat card to access options.  
- **Reassign Agent**: Reconfigure agents linked to a chat using edit option.  
- **Delete Chat**: Remove unused or obsolete chat apps.  
- **Search Chats**: Use the search bar to find chats by name.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Keep chat names descriptive and short.  
- Create separate chat apps for different business tasks (e.g., one for HR queries, another for finance).  
- Enable voice only if it fits your use case — like mobile support or accessibility.

Chat apps in Amplifi give your agents a **deployable, user-friendly interface** — ready to assist in real-time, across domains.

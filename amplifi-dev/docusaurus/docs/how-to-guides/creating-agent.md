# What Is an Agent?

An agent in Amplifi is a customized AI assistant that can interact with your data using natural language. Each agent can be tailored to a specific task or dataset by selecting the tools and LLM (large language model) it uses.

Agents make it easy to create purpose-built assistants for specific business needs â€” like answering support queries, interpreting financial documents, or navigating product manuals.

## Creating an Agent

Follow these steps to set up your own agent in Amplifi.

### Step 1: Access the Agent Creation Screen

1. Navigate to the **Agents** tab from the left sidebar.
2. Click the **Create New Agent** button in the top-right corner.

### Step 2: Fill in Agent Details

1. **Agent Name**:  
   Enter a name for your agent (max 30 characters).  

2. **Agent Description** (optional):  
   Briefly describe what this agent does (max 150 characters).  

3. **Select LLM Provider**:  
   Choose the language model that will power this agent.  
   Available options may include:  
   - **GPT-3.5** â€“ Fast, basic tasks only. Not for image/audio.  
   - **GPT-4.1** â€“ General-purpose with stronger reasoning.  
   - **GPT-4o** â€“ Best for text, image, and audio tasks.  
   - **o3-mini Reasoning** â€“ Lightweight, optimized for deep reasoning.

   Select the model that best fits your use case and data type.

4. **Select Tools to Associate**:  
   Pick one or more tools that the agent will use.  
   These tools are created earlier in the **Tools** tab and define how the agent accesses and interacts with datasets.

5. **Agent Instructions** (optional):  
   Add system-level instructions that guide the agentâ€™s behavior.  
   - Example: *Always be polite and concise in responses.*

### Step 3: Create the Agent

Once all fields are filled, click **Submit** to create the agent.  
Your new agent will now appear in the Agents list and can immediately be used for search or chat.

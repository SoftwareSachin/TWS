# What Is a Workflow?

A workflow in Amplifi helps transfer vector embeddings generated from ingestion into a destination of your choice. It automates the process of moving processed data, ensuring your destination system stays updated with the latest ingested vectors.

## Creating a Workflow

Workflows in Amplifi are essential for streamlining the transfer of data from datasets to destinations. Follow this guide to create your first workflow.

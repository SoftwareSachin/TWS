# Creating a Knowledge Graph

Once your dataset is ingested in Amplifi, you can generate a Knowledge Graph to extract and organize entities and their relationships.

## Step 1: Start Graph Creation

After ingestion, use the **Add Graph to Dataset** option to initiate graph generation. Amplifi will extract entities from your dataset using built-in models.

You can choose between:
- **Extract from Dataset**: Let Amplifi automatically detect relevant entities.
- **Define Manually**: Manually enter specific entities you want to include.

## Step 2: Review and Select Entities

Once entities are extracted, Amplifi shows a list of detected entity types. You can review and select which entity types to include in the graph.

## Step 3: Generate the Graph

After confirming the entity types, click to generate the graph. The system will process your selection in the background and create a structured network of entities and relationships.

## Step 4: View Graph Summary

Once the graph is ready, a summary is shown with:
- A list of **entity types**
- A **count** next to each type indicating how many entities were identified in that category

This helps you understand the distribution of entities across your dataset.

## Step 5: Explore Relationships

Switch to the **Graph Relationships** tab to see the relationships discovered between entities. These connections form the backbone of the Knowledge Graph and help link concepts together.

## Step 6: Manage the Graph

You can choose to:
- **Regenerate** the graph if the data changes or you want to modify entity selection
- **Delete** the graph if itâ€™s no longer needed

Creating a Knowledge Graph helps you uncover meaningful relationships in your data, improving both semantic understanding and search relevance.

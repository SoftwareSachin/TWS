# Agentic AI in Amplifi

Agentic AI enables Amplifi’s assistants to act **autonomously**, **reason through complex tasks**, and **invoke tools when needed** — making them much more than just chatbots.

Unlike standard LLMs that only respond to prompts, Agentic AI empowers Amplifi to **interpret intent**, **make decisions**, and **execute tasks step-by-step** using internal and external tools.

## 🧠 What is an Agent?

An **Agent** is an intelligent unit that:

- Understands natural language instructions
- Plans actions based on goals
- Retains and uses conversational memory
- Calls tools (e.g., search, code, visualization) to complete tasks
- Adapts based on outcomes and user input

> Think of an agent as an autonomous assistant that doesn’t just answer — it *acts*.

## ⚙️ Key Capabilities

| Capability      | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Autonomy**    | Makes decisions independently, chooses which tools to use                  |
| **Planning**    | Breaks down tasks into logical steps and sequences them                    |
| **Memory**      | Maintains context from past interactions for continuity                    |
| **Tool Use**    | Calls internal tools (vector search, SQL, web fetch, etc.) when required   |
| **Adaptability**| Refines answers based on changing input, results, or user feedback         |

## 🔄 Agent Flow in Amplifi

A simplified view of how agents operate:

1. **Receive** the user query
2. **Interpret** the goal or intent
3. **Plan** the necessary steps to reach the goal
4. **Invoke tools** where required (e.g., search or SQL)
5. **Aggregate and respond** with a final, grounded answer

This loop allows agents to reason and refine their answers rather than just reply.

## 🛠️ Agents vs. Tools

- **Agents** are the brains — they think, plan, and decide what to do.
- **Tools** are the hands — they do the work (like search, parse, visualize).
- Agents **orchestrate tool use** to solve problems end-to-end.
